# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract
- Multi-page React application that pulls movies from an external API that we can select to view more details.

#### Goals and Objectives

- Implement React and Router to turn our vanilla Javascript app into a true multi-page application
- Work with an API to render data from multiple specified endpoints
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust Cypress test suite that thoroughly tests all user stories

## Features
- Displays all movies by their posters

- Can return to the home page via the on page button or use of the browser navigation arrows.
- 60% accessibility score on Lighthouse and app is fully tabbable

## Possible Future Extensions
- Live dynamic searching

#### Milestones
- This project has given us more exposure to React and Router that we were able to apply and test with Cyrpess to ensure a better UX
